This is a different kind of solitatire game.

Click "File > New Game" to begin the game.

Feel free to start over in the middle of a game if you don't like the cards that are being dealt.

Click the deck in the upper left hand corner to deal a hand.

You may discard a card when:
	1) there exists at least one other top card that has the same suit
and
	2) the card's value is less than the value of the other top card with the same suit.

Discard a card by either:
	1) double clicking the card you want to discard
or
	2) click the card you want to discard and then click the discard pile in the upper right hand corner.

You cannot move cards from stack to stack. You may only move a top card to an empty stack space.

YOU WIN WHEN THERE ARE NO MORE CARDS TO DEAL AND ONLY ACES ARE LEFT! 

It is extremely difficult to win this game so don't feel bad if you have to start over several times.
